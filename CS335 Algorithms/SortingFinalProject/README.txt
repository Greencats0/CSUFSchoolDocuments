Run main.py to have the program run correctly
I used pygame and random as imports
I used the programming IDE PyCharm and used python version 3.9.0 


This program is the visualization of the MergeSorting Algorithm

The Sort goes much faster than visualized in the program so if you want to slow it down or speed it up
change the line self.clock.tick(self.speed)
and set the num to how fast you want it to go
Lower makes it slower, higher makes it faster, getting rid of the line just makes it go at base speed
